# HTML genereator using Typescript

This program fetches pokemon data in JSON format from an API, loads them in a specific class, processes them with Javascript and Typescript and embeds them into an HTML web page. It also creates subpages for each individual element of the data. Styling is done with CSS. Right now, the program loads 100 entries.
